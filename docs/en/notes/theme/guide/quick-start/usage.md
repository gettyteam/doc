# Getting Started

## Log in with Odysee

To configure getty, you only need to log in. You can log in with Wander, Odysee, or Twitch; it is secure and easy to use, allowing you to authenticate to getty without traditional passwords. This is essential to access getty features like widget configuration and channel analytics.

You only need to log in with your **Odysee account** and configure your channel statistics or metrics for your live stream. This allows your channel statistics to be imported into your getty account.

## If you use Wander: Back up your wallet.

We recommend backing up your Wander wallet in a safe place. This backup is also necessary when configuring your wallet on Odysee with Wander. To learn more about how to back up your wallet, visit the Odysee documentation. [Wander Integrated Wallet](https://help.odysee.tv/category-monetization/).

## Stream Metrics and Categories

In getty, you can see in real-time how your live stream is performing, with metrics for chat activity, tips, and live viewers. You can also see in real-time the type of category you are broadcasting to from Odysee via the type of tag you use in your live stream post on Odysee. Includes subcategories for different categories.

## Configure Live Analytics

Your live stream metrics are important for knowing the performance of every stream you do on Odysee. These analytics show aspects such as the number of hours per stream, average viewers, new followers, chat participants, unique visitors, and much more.

## Configure Live Chat

The live chat widget has several settings, but for it to work in your streaming software, you need to configure it from the getty admin panel. To do this, go to the chat page and then select the live post you created on Odysee from the menu.

In some cases, OBS Studio may cache a widget. If you notice strange behavior, you can refresh the widget from the browser source in OBS, clear the cache, and try again.
