## Hyperchat Notification + Text-to-Speech 🎤

The widget not only displays visual notifications when you receive Hyperchats or tips from Odysee, it also includes a **text-to-speech (TTS)** option so messages are read aloud on your stream, ideal for not missing any important comments if you are focused on the content.

==Text-to-speech (TTS) works with your operating system's voice package==

## Vertical and Horizontal Chat 💬

Choose between a vertical or horizontal Odysee chat to adapt to your stream layout. With advanced customization options (colors, fonts, and transparency), this widget improves interaction with your community. It is also compatible with your Twitch chat, you just have to log in with your Twitch account and you will have messages from both platforms when you are live on Odysee.

## Live Viewers 👀

The live viewers widget is an essential tool for ==streamers==, allowing to show in real time the number of viewers connected to the stream. This widget helps you check how many people are watching you, thanking their presence or motivating participation when numbers go up, but also serves as a metric to adjust content according to public reaction.
