## ==λ v1.1.3:== Nova

The new getty release (v1.1.3) is here! We remain committed to our mission of giving you the best tools so your live streams can succeed.

This release arrives right after our previous update, which focused on delivering clearer data and practical guidance about your performance. Now we refine those ideas and add new, powerful features to give you even more control and a smoother experience.

## More Efficient Real-Time Analytics

We optimized the system that manages your live data so it runs faster and more efficiently.

1. **Fewer interruptions, more performance:** We reorganized how information from your past streams is stored. The core system now operates with less load, resulting in a more responsive and stable app for you.
2. **Effortless data updates:** We improved how your key metrics are displayed, such as average viewers. Charts now animate smoothly when you activate them, making your data clearer and more engaging.

Live streaming analytics uses a hybrid database that manages and stores the history of every data point from your broadcast. As getty grows, this database will continue to receive improvements.

## New Public Profile Page

We want to help you share your analytics with others. That’s why we created a customizable public profile page where you can showcase your channel history. Activate it from the profile page in the admin whenever you want—it’s completely optional.

1. **Preview your channel:** Include your cover art, avatar, name, description, links, and a badge that shows whether you’re live.
2. **Share your success:** With a simple toggle, you can turn a public link on or off to share your profile. When it’s enabled, anyone can see your most relevant stats.
3. **Metrics that matter:** Your profile highlights your performance summary—hours streamed, average and peak viewers, and active days. It also includes an activity chart and a list of your recent streams with their key stats.

## Explore Your History with More Flexibility

The history section is now more powerful and easier to use.

1. **Search by specific dates:** Want to review the data for a particular week? We replaced the previous menu with a new date-range picker. Just choose a start and end date and the app will surface the exact information you need.
2. **Clearer visualizations:** Filters and buttons sport a new look that fits perfectly with dark mode and delivers a modern experience. Visualization tools now include helpful hover details, so you can understand your data faster.

## A Stronger, More Reliable Foundation

We shipped important technical improvements that make the app more robust.

1. **Greater technical stability:** We reorganized the server’s internal structure and routes to boost reliability and overall performance.
2. **Modernized widgets:** We completely refreshed the technology behind widgets (like donation goals and notifications), making them faster and easier to maintain. They now integrate seamlessly with your stream.
3. **More dependable connections:** We updated and verified integrations with external services, removing unreliable sources. Critical features—such as transaction verification—remain consistently stable.

## Better Visibility and a Consistent Visual Experience

Your online presence matters, both inside and outside of getty.

1. **Search-engine ready (SEO):** We aligned the homepage information and added dedicated files (`sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`) so your profile and the platform are easier to discover on the web.
2. **Consistent theming everywhere:** We enhanced the light/dark theme system so your preference saves and syncs correctly—even when you have multiple tabs open. The visual experience stays consistent across the entire platform.

## Welcome Page

Key elements such as icons, text, and color combinations received refinements on the presentation page. You can now explore the most important highlights of getty in greater detail on the landing and welcome screens. Take a look and enjoy the experience.
