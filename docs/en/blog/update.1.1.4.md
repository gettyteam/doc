## ==λ v1.1.4:== Handshake

getty v1.1.4: Handshake has arrived, and we are very excited to share all the details.

This is not just a simple incremental update; it is an **architectural restructuring** that lays the foundation for the future, incorporating immediate improvements for streamers, creators, and communities.

This version symbolizes the handshake between robustness and a modern user interface, between the power of new features and a more balanced user experience. From a **universal search engine** to the full integration of **Wuzzy** and a new unified dashboard. Every change is designed to offer more control, better performance, and more intuitive community management.

## New Search System

Finding the right feature in a dashboard full of options can be a complicated task. With getty v1.1.4, we introduce a **smart search system** powered by [fuse](https://www.fusejs.io/).

**Need to adjust the chat theme?** Simply search for ==chat==. Want to change the tip notification sound? Type ==notification==. This tool drastically reduces configuration time and makes the platform more accessible for new users.

## Admin Dashboard

**Robust Stream Metrics:** We implemented a **backup system** for the latest stream metrics, ensuring you always have data available even in case of unforeseen events. **Persistent Chat History:** Chat widgets now **remember the last messages**. The conversation is not lost upon reloading, maintaining context and community engagement.

**Real Chatter Count:** The logic for counting unique users in the chat has been improved, providing **precise real-time data** that is also permanently saved in the stream history for later analysis. **New Recommendations:** We have added relevant modules to the dashboard's **recommendation slider**, suggesting useful features based on common usage.

## Wuzzy Integration

Wuzzy is not just another feature; it is the full integration of a permaweb media search engine into getty. Search for images or audio for your notifications or alerts.

[Wuzzy Search](https://wuzzy.arweave.net/) represents an innovative approach to web indexing and search, based on the AO (Actor Oriented) protocol and the ==Arweave ecosystem==. Unlike traditional search engines that rely on centralized infrastructure, Wuzzy implements a decentralized architecture where autonomous agents serve results in a distributed manner.

Search and select images or audio with Wuzzy directly from the settings of your favorite widget or module in getty. The backend automatically adopts external images when saving.

## UX/UI Improvements

**Channel Statistics:** New dedicated page with views/uploaded content charts, total metrics (views, followers, videos), and time range selection. **Style Editor and Social Media Validation:** You can now manually enter HEX codes next to the color picker.

**Integration Improvements:** You can now automatically notify your community on Discord when a new video is uploaded to your Odysee channel. Configure a Discord webhook and the channel ClaimID to announce each video or post just once.

With getty v1.1.4 "Handshake", the update not only introduces powerful tools like global search and Wuzzy with Arweave, but also rebuilds the platform's foundations on a modern, reactive, and maintainable architecture.

**Log in on getty and discover all the improvements that help your streams reach new levels.**
