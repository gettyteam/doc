## ==λ v1.1.5:== dýnami

Introducing getty v1.1.5: dýnami. Our last update of 2025 includes new tools and important security changes for your channel's growth and a more stable experience for you and your viewers.

# Log in with Odysee

Now you can access getty using your **Odysee account** and configure overlays, widgets, and analytics for your channels or live streams. You just need to enter the email and password of your Odysee account. This integration expands your options, allowing you to choose the login method you prefer for your getty account.

If you are already enjoying this new way of access, you might want to explore the additional layer of security.

# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

We have implemented a new security system with Two-Factor Authentication. You can activate it in User Settings after logging in with Odysee. The system supports applications like **Authy, Bitwarden, or Ente Auth**. It is essential that you save the recovery codes shown during setup in a safe place, as they are your only backup if you lose access to your authenticator device.

# New achievement system for Odysee followers

In addition to existing achievements (Viewers, Chat Messages, Live Time, and Tips), getty now integrates specific achievements for your Odysee channel growth. By surpassing follower milestones, you will unlock achievements like "Emerging Streamer" (10 followers), "Rising Star" (100 followers), or "Streaming Legend" (100,000 followers).

Each unlocked achievement will trigger a notification on your live stream from OBS or Meld Studio, allowing you to celebrate these key moments with your community.

# Follower Goal Widget

Introducing the new "Goal Followers" widget. From the admin panel, you can configure a custom follower goal for your Odysee channel. The widget will show a real-time progress bar in OBS or Meld Studio. Upon reaching 100% of the goal, a confetti effect and an optional sound will play. We recommend using this widget to create community events and motivate your audience.

# Persistent Chat History

The chat widget for OBS now preserves message history. If you refresh the browser source or start a new stream, the latest messages will remain visible. You can manually clear this history from the chat settings in the admin panel.

# Dynamic Fire Effect in Chat

We have added a visual gamification system to the chat. The most active users will see a flame animation next to their name, whose intensity and a combo counter (e.g., x2, x3) increase with the frequency of their consecutive messages. This effect automatically adapts to the chat mode.

# Responsive interface for mobile and tablets

The getty interface now fully adapts to mobile devices and tablets. You can manage all configurations, widgets, and analytics of your stream directly from any device.

# Fixes and Stability Improvements

The default chat widget theme has been stabilized, eliminating flickering on load. The suggestions card has been relocated, and the sidebar now only scrolls when necessary.

Channel analytics now include Odysee **"fires" and "slimes"**, and the dynamic avatar in the sidebar will automatically update once you configure your channel in the analytics section.

We recommend exploring and configuring the new **Follower Goal widget** to interact with your community, activate **Two-Factor Authentication** to protect your account and configure your channel analytics.
