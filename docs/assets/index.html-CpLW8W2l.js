In our ongoing mission to provide the best tools to make your streams a success, this update focuses on <strong>improving stability, refining the visual experience, and —most importantly— delivering clearer data and actionable insights about your live performance</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://thumbs.odycdn.com/0033367574cbd972572baa171e4e1d60.webp" alt="getty"></p><p>We listened to your feedback and worked hard to polish details and ship meaningful upgrades, especially across <strong>real-time analytics</strong> and the <strong>tip and achievement notification system</strong>.</p><h2 id="more-robust-more-precise-live-analytics" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#more-robust-more-precise-live-analytics"><span>More robust, more precise live analytics</span></a></h2><p>Understanding your audience is key. That’s why we optimized and fixed our <strong>Live Analytics</strong> charts so they’re more reliable and easier to interpret.</p><ul><li><strong>Clearer time segments:</strong> We resolved an issue that could delay closing segments in the chart, now capping them at 90 minutes. This gives you a more precise, real-time view of how your audience fluctuates during a live stream.</li><li><strong>Flexible goal configuration:</strong> You can now personalize and configure the <strong>Peak Viewers badge</strong> and the <strong>daily hours goal</strong> directly from the dashboard, tailoring metrics to your own targets.</li><li><strong>Goal line in history:</strong> To help you visualize your goals, we added a <strong>new goal line to the stream history chart</strong>, letting you see exactly when you surpassed expectations.</li></ul><p><img src="https://thumbs.odycdn.com/f6efdb258f171eab858482e3402ffc78.webp" alt="getty"></p><h2 id="optimized-tip-and-achievement-notifications" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#optimized-tip-and-achievement-notifications"><span>Optimized tip and achievement notifications</span></a></h2><p>We want every tip and unlocked achievement to be celebrated seamlessly. This release brings important improvements on that front:</p><ul><li><strong>More stable widgets:</strong> The <strong>Tip Goal</strong> and <strong>Tip Notification</strong> widgets received significant upgrades to feel smoother and more reliable, ensuring your community never misses a moment of appreciation.</li><li><strong>Separate custom audio storage:</strong> Your <strong>custom audio for tips and achievements now saves independently</strong>. This avoids mix-ups and guarantees you sound exactly how you want for each notification type.</li><li><strong>Perfect sync:</strong> We applied fixes to keep tip notifications and chat messages fully in sync, removing mix-ups or delays — especially in multi-tenant mode.</li></ul><h2 id="other-key-improvements-and-fixes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#other-key-improvements-and-fixes"><span>Other key improvements and fixes</span></a></h2><p>Beyond the headline features, this update ships a long list of refinements that elevate the overall experience:</p><ul><li><strong>New events widget:</strong> We added a <strong>recent events widget</strong> that you can use as a browser source in OBS — perfect for showcasing recent interactions with style.</li><li><strong>Reorganized history panel:</strong> We moved the “Settings” button to the header next to the “Activity” title for more intuitive navigation, and gave it a signature pink style.</li><li><strong>Improved raffle system:</strong> We fixed the “Clear all” button so it properly resets the state, wipes winner data, and stays in sync between the admin panel and widgets.</li><li><strong>More resilient connections:</strong> We shipped fixes for <strong>automatic WebSocket reconnection</strong> in the chat widget and audio notifications, keeping your chat connection active and stable.</li><li><strong>More stable admin panel:</strong> We solved a routing issue that incorrectly redirected to the dashboard when refreshing the page inside the status section.</li></ul><h2 id="how-to-update" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-update"><span>How to update</span></a></h2><p>The update will roll out automatically to the online version.
