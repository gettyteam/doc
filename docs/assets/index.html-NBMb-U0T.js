It&#39;s not necessary to configure all of them, but if you need to set up the most basic ones, here we show you how to configure the most important widgets.</p><p><img src="https://thumbs.odycdn.com/daa2905e83e9ca900b2193a17cd15678.webp" alt="getty"></p><h2 id="configure-live-analytics" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#configure-live-analytics"><span>Configure Live Analytics</span></a></h2><p>The metrics of your live streams are important so you can know the performance of each live stream you do on Odysee.
