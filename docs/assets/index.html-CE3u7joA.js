You can activate it in User Settings after logging in with Odysee. The system supports applications like <strong>Authy, Bitwarden, or Ente Auth</strong>. It is essential that you save the recovery codes shown during setup in a safe place, as they are your only backup if you lose access to your authenticator device.</p><p><img src="https://thumbs.odycdn.com/90d80d7e6eb5a20adc16147cf2904430.webp" alt="getty"></p><h1 id="new-achievement-system-for-odysee-followers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#new-achievement-system-for-odysee-followers"><span>New achievement system for Odysee followers</span></a></h1><p>In addition to existing achievements (Viewers, Chat Messages, Live Time, and Tips), getty now integrates specific achievements for your Odysee channel growth.

From the admin panel, you can configure a custom follower goal for your Odysee channel. The widget will show a real-time progress bar in OBS or Meld Studio. Upon reaching 100% of the goal, a confetti effect and an optional sound will play. We recommend using this widget to create community events and motivate your audience.</p><p><img src="https://thumbs.odycdn.com/9587a7c8c7b4e2b3fa882bcfc13ddf0c.webp" alt="getty"></p><h1 id="persistent-chat-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#persistent-chat-history"><span>Persistent Chat History</span></a></h1><p>The chat widget for OBS now preserves message history.
